## CORE BEHAVIORS

| Behavior | Rule |
|----------|------|
| **Autonomy** | Execute immediately, never ask unnecessary permission |
| **Fix > Report** | Fix issues, don't just list them |
| **Verify Visually** | Use browser tools, take screenshots |
| **Never Assume** | Always verify changes worked |
| **Honest** | Never lie, never deceive, admit uncertainty |
| **Zero Fluff** | Get to the point, no unnecessary explanations |

### NEVER Do:
- Say "please refresh" - YOU verify it yourself
- Assume changes worked without proof
- Give fake progress
- Hide uncertainty
- Leave broken code

---

## PHASED WORK (MANDATORY)

All work MUST be organized into PHASES and STEPS:

```
PHASE 1: [Name]
  Step 1.1: [Description]
  Step 1.2: [Description]

PHASE 2: [Name]
  Step 2.1: [Description]
```

**Rules:**
- Complete Phase 1 before starting Phase 2
- Verify each phase before moving to next
- Report progress by phase and step
- Use TODO lists for complex tasks

---

## VERIFICATION (MANDATORY)

**NEVER claim something works without verifying:**

1. Test clone results in actual browser
2. Check for errors
3. Verify functionality works
4. Report what you actually saw

**NEVER assume** - Always verify execution paths, API calls, etc.

---

## TECHNICAL STACK (FROZEN)

### Runtime
- **Node.js LTS** (current)
- **npm** (no yarn, no pnpm, no bun)

### Backend
- **Express 4.x** + TypeScript
- **Puppeteer** for browser automation
- **Sharp** for image optimization

### Frontend
- **React 18.x** + Vite 5.x
- **TypeScript 5.x**

## MCP SERVERS (AVAILABLE)

You have access to these MCP servers:
- **desktop-commander** - Desktop automation, screenshots
- **sequential-thinking** - Complex reasoning
- **filesystem** - File operations
- **memory** - Session memory

## CLONE ENGINE RULES

### Quality Standards
- Clone score must be 90%+ to pass
- All internal links must work
- All assets must be downloaded
- CSS styling must be preserved
- JavaScript interactions preserved where possible

### What Makes a Good Clone:
1. Visual fidelity to original (90%+ match)
2. All assets downloaded locally
3. Internal navigation works
4. Responsive behavior preserved
5. No broken images or styles

### Testing Clones:
1. Run clone on target URL
2. Check verification score
3. Open in browser to visual compare
4. Test internal navigation
5. Check asset loading

## ERROR HANDLING

| Severity | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **BLOCKER** | Stop everything, fix now |
| **MAJOR** | Fix before moving on |
| **MINOR** | Fix if time permits |
| **COSMETIC** | Note for later |

---

## DECISION PRIORITY

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Bug blocking other work | Fix immediately |
| Security vulnerability | Fix immediately, document |
| Test failing | Fix before continuing |
| Clone quality issue | Improve cloner algorithm |
| Performance issue | Document, fix if quick (<30 min) |

---

## AUTONOMY RULES

**Execute without asking:**
- Code edits
- Running commands
- Installing dependencies

---

## STARTUP SEQUENCE

When starting the project:

---

## CODE QUALITY

- Production-grade code only
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper logging
