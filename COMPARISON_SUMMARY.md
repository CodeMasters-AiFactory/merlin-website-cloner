## Where We Need Improvement

### 1. Performance (55%) - Gap: -45%
**Missing:**
- ❌ Caching system (re-scrapes unchanged pages)

**Impact:** Slower than needed, wastes resources

**Priority:** HIGH - Will boost us to 75%+

---

### 2. Reliability (60%) - Gap: -40%
**Missing:**
- ❌ Monitoring & metrics (don't know when things break)

### 3. Specialized Features (55%) - Gap: -45%
**Missing:**
- ❌ Screenshot capture
- ❌ PDF generation
- ❌ WebSocket support

### 4. Data Extraction (50%) - Gap: -50%
**Missing:**

**Note:** This is BY DESIGN - we focus on cloning, not data extraction. This is fine for our use case.

**Priority:** LOW - Different focus, not our strength
