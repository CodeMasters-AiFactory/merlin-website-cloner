# Learning & Adaptation Rules

## Learn From Mistakes

### When Something Fails
1. Document what went wrong
2. Identify root cause
3. Note what you should have done
4. Add to checklist if pattern
5. Apply learning immediately

### Mistake Log Format
```
## Mistake: [Brief description]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Impact:** [What broke]
**Root Cause:** [Why it happened]
**Prevention:** [How to avoid in future]
**Applied:** [What rule/checklist updated]
```

## Learn From Success

### When Something Works Well
1. Note what made it successful
2. Identify reusable patterns
3. Document for future reference
4. Apply to similar situations

## Pattern Recognition

### Track These Patterns
- Common error types and fixes
- Successful debugging approaches
- Efficient workflows
- Code patterns that work
- Test patterns that catch bugs

### Create Playbooks
When pattern appears 3+ times:
1. Document the pattern
2. Create step-by-step guide
3. Add to appropriate rules file
4. Reference in future

## Feedback Integration

### When User Provides Feedback
1. Acknowledge the feedback
2. Understand the issue
3. Implement correction
4. Verify user is satisfied
5. Update rules if needed

### Feedback Types
| Type | Action |
|------|--------|
| "Don't do X" | Add to NEVER DO list |
| "Always do Y" | Add to ALWAYS DO list |
| "That was wrong" | Fix and prevent recurrence |
| "That was good" | Reinforce behavior |
| "Try this way" | Learn and apply |

## Context Retention

### Remember Across Sessions
- Project structure and architecture
- User preferences and patterns
- Previous blockers and solutions
- What works and what doesn't
- Naming conventions used

### Update Memory When
- New preference discovered
- Workflow changed
- Architecture updated
- New tool introduced
- User corrects something

## Skill Development

### Areas to Improve
- Faster debugging
- Better error messages
- Cleaner code
- More thorough testing
- Better documentation
- Fewer mistakes

### How to Improve
1. Review mistakes weekly
2. Analyze time spent
3. Identify inefficiencies
4. Research better approaches
5. Practice new techniques

## Knowledge Base

### Maintain Internal Knowledge Of
- Project-specific patterns
- Common issues and solutions
- User preferences
- API behaviors
- Edge cases discovered
- Performance optimizations

### Document In
- Rules files (this folder)
- Code comments
- README updates
- Progress file notes

## Adaptation Triggers

### Adapt Immediately When
- User expresses frustration
- Same error occurs twice
- Process takes too long
- Output quality insufficient
- Rules conflict with reality

### Adaptation Process
1. Recognize need for change
2. Analyze what's not working
3. Propose improvement
4. Implement change
5. Monitor results
6. Refine if needed
