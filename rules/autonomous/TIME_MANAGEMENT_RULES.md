# Time Management Rules

## Session Planning

### At Session Start
1. Review previous session notes (2 min)
2. Check blockers/priorities (2 min)
3. Plan 3-5 tasks for session (3 min)
4. Estimate time per task (2 min)
5. Start with highest priority

### Session Structure
```
Session Duration: ~4 hours typical

0:00 - 0:10  | Setup & Planning
0:10 - 1:30  | Deep work block 1
1:30 - 1:40  | Progress check & commit
1:40 - 3:00  | Deep work block 2
3:00 - 3:10  | Progress check & commit
3:10 - 3:50  | Final work block
3:50 - 4:00  | Session wrap-up & notes
```

## Task Time Estimates

### By Task Type
| Task Type | Estimate | Max Before Reassess |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| Bug fix (simple) | 15 min | 30 min |
| Bug fix (complex) | 45 min | 2 hours |
| Small feature | 30 min | 1 hour |
| Medium feature | 2 hours | 4 hours |
| Large feature | 4+ hours | Split into smaller |
| Investigation | 30 min | 1 hour |
| Documentation | 20 min | 45 min |
| Testing | 30 min | 1 hour |

### Time Boxing
- If task exceeds estimate by 50%, stop and reassess
- Either: task is more complex (update estimate)
- Or: you're stuck (try different approach)
- Or: task should be split

## Focus Rules

### Deep Work Blocks
- Minimum 50 minutes uninterrupted
- One task at a time
- No context switching mid-task
- Complete or checkpoint before switching

### When to Switch Tasks
- Task completed
- Blocked on external factor
- Exceeded time box significantly
- Higher priority emerged

### Context Switching Cost
| Switch Type | Recovery Time |
|-------------|---------------|
| Same project, same area | 2 min |
| Same project, different area | 10 min |
| Different project | 20 min |
| After interruption | 15 min |

## Progress Tracking

### Track Per Task
- Start time
- End time
- Actual vs estimated
- Blockers encountered
- Outcome (complete/partial/blocked)

### Daily Summary
```
Tasks planned: 5
Tasks completed: 4
Tasks blocked: 1
Time spent: 4 hours
Biggest time sink: Database migration (took 2x estimate)
Tomorrow priority: Unblock payments integration
```

## Deadlines

### Self-Imposed Deadlines
| Priority | Feature Deadline |
|----------|------------------|
| P1 (Critical) | Today |
| P2 (High) | This week |
| P3 (Medium) | Next week |
| P4 (Low) | When time permits |

### Meeting Deadlines
- Break into smaller tasks
- Track daily progress
- Identify risks early
- Communicate if slipping

## Efficiency Tips

### Reduce Waste
- Don't over-engineer
- Don't premature optimize
- Don't gold-plate (good enough is enough)
- Don't context switch unnecessarily
- Don't repeat yourself (automate)

### Increase Speed
- Use code snippets/templates
- Learn keyboard shortcuts
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Keep tools ready (browser, terminal)
- Document common commands

## When Running Late

### If Behind Schedule
1. Assess remaining work
2. Identify what can be cut
3. Focus on MVP/core functionality
4. Defer nice-to-haves
5. Communicate if deadline at risk

### Priority Order When Rushed
1. Core functionality works
2. Basic error handling
3. Critical tests
4. Documentation
5. Polish (last)

## Session End Protocol

### Must Do (5 min minimum)
1. Commit all work
2. Update progress file
3. Note where you stopped
4. Note next steps
5. Leave codebase working

### Record
- What was accomplished
- What's still pending
- Any blockers discovered
- Recommended next actions
